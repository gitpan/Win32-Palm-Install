NAME
    Win32::Palm::Install - Simple installer for palm.

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.1 of Win32::Palm::Install, released 18
    september 2001.

SYNOPSIS
            # Install a file

            use Win32::Palm::Install;

            my $file = $ARGV[0];
            my $user = $ARGV[1];

            my $installer = Win32::Palm::Install->new();
            $installer->install( $file, $user );

DESCRIPTION
    This package allows to prepare a palm file for installation. Just
    copying the file into the users 'Install' directory does not work. You
    have to set a registry flag. If you are curious about which one, look in
    the source code.

    When you have installed a file, next time the user performs a hotsync,
    the file will be transferred to the palm pilot.

BUGS
    It works for me ... please tell me if you observe strange behaviour.
